This a default Crowdbotics app. It is setup with a minimal amount of code/markup to deploy a static site to Heroku.

`app.json` -> Describes the repository to Heroku.

`composer.json` -> Identifies the repository as a PHP app to Heroku.

`index.php` -> The PHP script we're using to display the page statically.

`home.html` -> The static page we're showing. Feel free to change this and redeploy!

`README.md` -> This file.

After you deploy the site, give it ~10 seconds to build and then go to the page to see your changes.
